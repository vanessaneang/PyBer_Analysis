# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview:
To make comparisons between different city types and summarize the data in a summary data table to make an informed decision for PyBer. These comparisons will be based on the three dity types, urban, suburban and rural with average fares per ride and average fares by driver being one of the readouts. Several graphs have been made to determine what patterns are prevalent in the data and what would be the best course of action for PyBer.


## Results:

From this Summary Data Table of that groups the Total Rides, Drivers, Fares, Average Fare per Ride, and Average Fare per Driver by City Type we can see that Urban Cities tend to have more rides and drivers, but a lower cost per ride and driver. To better visualize this data, a matplotlib bubble chart was made to show the average fare vs total rides based on city types. 

![Fig 1 Bubble Chart](https://github.com/vanessaneang/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/Fig1.png)

This bubble charts bases the circle or plot point size on the average amount of fares, larger circles means higher amount of fares while smaller circles are lower amount of fares. The distribution of total number of rides based on city types shows that Rural Cities tend to have less rides, but higher fares, whilc Urban Cities have more rides and lower fares. Suburban Cities are in the middle, with a decent amount of rides and moderate fares. The next question we would like to see the data distributed as are box plots to see if there are any outliers that may be skewing the data.

There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. (7 pt)
Summary:

There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types. (4 pt)
