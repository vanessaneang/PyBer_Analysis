# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview:
To make comparisons between different city types and summarize the data in a summary data table to make an informed decision for PyBer. These comparisons will be based on the three dity types, urban, suburban and rural with average fares per ride and average fares by driver being one of the readouts. Several graphs have been made to determine what patterns are prevalent in the data and what would be the best course of action for PyBer.


## Results:

From this Summary Data Table of that groups the Total Rides, Drivers, Fares, Average Fare per Ride, and Average Fare per Driver by City Type we can see that Urban Cities tend to have more rides and drivers, but a lower cost per ride and driver. To better visualize this data, a matplotlib bubble chart was made to show the average fare vs total rides based on city types. 

![Fig 1 Bubble Chart](https://github.com/vanessaneang/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/Fig1.png)

This bubble charts bases the circle or plot point size on the average amount of fares, larger circles means higher amount of fares while smaller circles are lower amount of fares. The distribution of total number of rides based on city types shows that Rural Cities tend to have less rides, but higher fares, whilc Urban Cities have more rides and lower fares. Suburban Cities are in the middle, with a decent amount of rides and moderate fares. The next question we would like to see the data distributed as are box plots to see if there are any outliers that may be skewing the data.

Based on the different box plots of the three city types it looks like the data sets are fairly accurate, with little outliers, that would significantly skew the data. The data sets thus can be trusted to see what future directions the company should go for. Lets look at the data in a pie chart to see if there are any interesting details that should suggest any prominent trends.

From these figures we can see that Urban Cities account for **62.7%** of Pyber's total revenue despite having cheaper fares than both Suburban and Rural Cities. In addition, the total percent of rides in Urban Citites is **68.4%** of Pyber's total number of rides. Lastly, the totl number of drives seems to be largely Urban City based, with Urban cities accounting for **80.9%** of drivers on the app. 

Now we'll look at if there any trends in specific times of the year where Pyber should market more or change their prices. 

![Pyber Fare Summary](https://github.com/vanessaneang/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/Pyber_fare_summary.png)

For all three city types it seems that there is spike or peak in fare price around the end of Feburary and beginning of March, with varying levels of dips between the three city types for the lowests fares. For Urban Cities the lowest point for fares seems to be at the beginning of January. For Suburban beginning of January and mid-April seems to be the cheapest of fares. Rural Cities, have their lowest fares in Janurary and in mid-February, just before the peak.

## Summary:

There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types. (4 pt)
**There are three suggestions for Pyber to address the disparities among the different city types:**
Based on the data, it seems that the most sucessful cities that bring in the highest revenue are Urban Cities, if the CEO wants to see more revenue, **(1) increasing the cost for Urban City Rides**. However, the cost of each ride in Rural and Suburban areas may be deterring clients from using Pyber's services, so **(2) decreasing the fare for these areas may lead to more riders which in turn could lead to more driver's registered with Pyber.** The last suggestion for PyBer would be
